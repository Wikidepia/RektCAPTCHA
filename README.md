A proof of concept Recaptcha solver using pretrained YOLOv5 and Selenium. This tutorial shows that with a better trained object detection weight file, ReCAPTCHA can be easily solved.

## Limitation

This implementation relied on available pretrained models, which doesnt solve all type of ReCAPTCHA. Also, mouse movement is not human-like enough.
